## 🔍 System Flow Confirmed

### ✅ Withdrawal System (CORRECT)

**When user requests withdrawal:**
1. Check balance sufficient
2. Calculate 2% fee
3. Create withdrawal record (status: pending)
4. **Deduct amount from balance IMMEDIATELY**
5. Log transaction

**When admin approves withdrawal:**
1. Update withdrawal status to 'approved'
2. Set approved_at timestamp
3. Log admin action
4. **Balance already deducted** (nothing to do)

**This is the correct flow!** ✅

Money leaves the account when requested, approval just changes status for tracking/processing.

## 💡 Key Findings

### ✅ What Works Correctly

1. **ETH to USD Conversion** - Accurate real-time pricing
2. **Deposit System** - Correct amount credited
3. **Withdrawal System** - Balance deducted immediately on request
4. **Purchase System** - Correct deductions
5. **Balance Tracking** - All calculations accurate
6. **Admin Approvals** - Status updates correct

### ⚠️ Minor Tracking Issue

**Field:** `users.total_withdrawn`  
**Current Value:** $0.00  
**Should Be:** $312.00

**Impact:** Cosmetic only - doesn't affect actual balance  
**Priority:** Low - fix when convenient

The balance calculations are 100% correct, but the summary field `total_withdrawn` isn't being updated. This is just for reporting/display purposes.
