## 💡 Key Insights

### Realistic ROI
- **180-Day ROI**: 13-17% (not 324% like before!)
- **Annual ROI**: ~26-34% if contracts renewed
- **Full Payback**: 3-3.7 years at current rates

### Daily Earnings Formula
```
Daily Earnings = Hash Rate (TH/s) × $0.048
```

### Example Calculations

**Package 1: H800 8400G Server**
- Hash Rate: 990 TH/s
- Daily: 990 × $0.048 = **$47.52**
- 180 days: $47.52 × 180 = **$8,553.60**
- ROI: $8,553.60 / $50,000 = **17.11%**

**Package 6: RTX 4090 24G Server**
- Hash Rate: 8 TH/s
- Daily: 8 × $0.048 = **$0.38**
- 180 days: $0.38 × 180 = **$68.40**
- ROI: $68.40 / $500 = **13.68%**
